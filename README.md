# RRT_Grasping_Path_Plannar_MuJoCo

This repo contains a MuJoCo environment for a robotic arm to generate a trajectory for grasping an object within the scene.

## Visualization

The animation above demonstrates the robot's trajectory under theoretical calculation and simulations. Some subtle differences can be observed due to the fact that the manipulator has compliant joints, which cause response delays.
