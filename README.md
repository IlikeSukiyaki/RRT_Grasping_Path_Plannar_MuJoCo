# RRT_Grasping_Path_Plannar_MuJoCo
This repo contains a MuJoCo env for robotic arm to generate trajectory for grapsing a object within the scene.

## Visualization

The animation above demonstrates the robot's trajectory under theoretical calculation and simulations. Some subtle differences can be observed due to the fact that manipulator has complaiant joints and hence cause response delays.
